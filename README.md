# Problem Set 8.3
### Working with the `useContext` and `useReducer`

## Directions
Create a Todo List App. Your app should allow a user to create and delete "todo's". Additionally, your app must meet the following two requirements:
1. Your app should have a global store to store state using `Context`.
2. Your app should use `useReducer` to manage state.

### Extra Credit
* Add the ability to update a Todo.
* Add the ability to view a Todo by rendering a modal when a todo is clicked.
* Persist your data to storage using the `localStorage` API.
* Experiment with [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for some out-of-the-box styling on your components.
