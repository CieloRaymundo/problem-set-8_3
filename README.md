# Problem Set 8.3
### Working with the `useContext` and `useReducer`

## Directions
Refactor your Tic-Tac-Toe app with `useContext` and `useReducer`. Your app must meet the following two requirements:
1. Your app should have a global store to store state using `Context`.
2. Your app should use `useReducer` to manage state.

### Extra Credit
* Add a scoreboard.
* Persist your data to storage using the `localStorage` API.
* Experiment with [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for some out-of-the-box styling on your components.
